1. Alexander Kashlinsky used the term "dark flow" to describe an unexplained form of this quantity in
galaxy clusters. The statistical dispersion of this quantity for an elliptical galaxy is related to its luminosity
by the Faber-Jackson relation. This quantity's value relative to a rest frame is called the "peculiar" type of
it, and it is not explained by (*) Hubble's Law. The change in this quantity is related to the logarithm of the initial
mass divided by the final mass by the rocket equation. By setting the kinetic energy equal to the potential energy,
one can derive the minimum value for this quantity for an object to escape from a body's gravitational field. For 10
points, name this quantity, the time derivative of position.
ANSWER: velocity [or motion; or speed] <Jose>
2. During this conflict, Leon Chester Thrasher died on the Falaba. In this war, Ralph Van Deman helped

3. Peptide bonds are reduced by this element in the Lowry assay for protein concentration. Complex IV of
the ETC relies on iron and this element exchanging electrons. This element's tetraammine complex is
colored indigo, making it a great detector for ammonia. The original high-temperature superconductors
were oxides of this element. It only forms +1 and +2 oxidation states. This element and (*) zinc made up a

in which a hotel where the main characters sleep together and another character's play are among the
things called a variant of "The (*) Enchanted Hunter". This author who wrote about an employee of Waindell
College in Pnin also created Charles Kinbote, who believes himself to be the King of Zembla and provides

5. In the Argonautica, Polydeuces kills the Bebrycian king Amycus with a pair of these objects made of
cowhide. In the Aeneid, Entellus wins a contest using a cestus, an object of this kind. In the Gylfaginning,
one of these objects owned by Utgard-Loki turns out to be the "great hall" in which Thor and his servants
had experienced earthquakes during the night. A set of these objects had to be used because a gadfly sent
by Loki distracted Brokkr and forced him to make a (*) weapon's handle much shorter than it should have
been. The belt Megingjorth, a hammer, and a set of these objects named Jarngreipr are the most important
possessions of the Norse god of thunder. For 10 points, name these items of clothing, an iron pair of which enables
Thor to grasp Mjolnir.
ANSWER: gloves [or gauntlets] <Zhang>
6. The second section of this ballet begins with the strings playing persistent eighth-note double stops

interrupted by the "Procession of the Wise Elder." In the final section of this ballet, which changes meter
almost every measure, a (*) chosen victim dances herself to death. An unusually high bassoon solo opens this

9. In the late 1950s, Lacey and Lacey's studies of responses to this phenomenon introduced the concept of
"individual response-stereotypy." Modern understanding of this concept began in studies of a three-stage
condition called GAS, or General Adaptation Syndrome, by Hans Selye (SEL-yay). The Social
Readjustment Rating Scale measures the likelihood that this condition has been caused by major life
events. It's not heart disease, but lower incidence of this thing distinguishes (*) "Type B" personalities from
"Type A" personalities. The long-term type of this response results in release of the hormone cortisol. Lazarus and
Folkman's first study of "coping responses" defined them as reactions to this condition. For 10 points, name this
psychological response to disturbing stimuli.
ANSWER: stress response <Jackson>

10. A character in this novel complains to the Duchess of Monmouth that "the man who could call a spade
a spade should be compelled to use one." This novel's preface states that "dislike of realism is the rage of
Caliban upon seeing his own face" before stating "all art is quite useless." A sailor in this novel overhears
a man being called "Prince Charming", though that man's (*) youthful face puts off the sailor's accusations
that he was responsible for the suicide of the Shakespearean actress Sibyl Vane. The painter Basil Hallward is

12. Measuring this value for a semiconductor is done with a four-point probe and allows one to determine
the concentration of impurities. A device first fabricated at HP Labs using a thin film of titanium dioxide
has a value for this quantity that depends on the history of current in the device. After the turn-on voltage,
an ideal diode has a value of zero for this quantity. An unknown value of this quantity can be found by
setting up a diamond shape and adjusting until there's no voltage drop across the bridge, a method
popularized by Charles (*) Wheatstone. This quantity is the real part of impedance. For a wire this quantity equals
rho times length over cross-sectional area, where rho is the inverse of the conductivity. This quantity adds when its
namesake circuit elements are placed in series. For 10 points, what quantity is equal to voltage divided by current, by
Ohm's law?
ANSWER: resistance [or R; or resistivity or rho until "impedance" is read] <Schindler>

law banning female displays of wealth, the Lex Oppia, who shared the consulship with his mentor Lucius
Valerius Flaccus, and wrote the Origines, the first prose history in Latin. This is also the family name of
the politician who, after hearing about the Republican defeat at the Battle of Thapsus, committed suicide

in a western "Anti-" section of this range, whose easternmost portion is called the (*) Aurès region. The
Ourika and Draa Rivers flow through part of this range, which is separated by the Sebou River from the Rif region

protagonist's severed head being buried in a cave inside of which is a shrine made of marble. One author
who wrote in this language wrote A Winter in Majorca, which recounts her passionate affair with a (*)
composer. This language was used to write a novel in which the son of a woodcutter falls in love with Mathilde de
la Mole and struggles between choosing the army or the clergy. That novel in this language, which depicts the rise

24. The worst case runtime of Floyd's algorithm is a cubic function based on the number of these objects
in the input. An articulation type of one of these things creates at least one new component and is more
commonly called the "cut" type of these things. One of Karp's 21 problems involves finding the minimum
number of these things that form a cover. An alternative to the Bellman-Ford algorithm repeatedly checks
to see if a new (*) distance to one of these things is less than the best known distance. The cities in the NP-Hard
