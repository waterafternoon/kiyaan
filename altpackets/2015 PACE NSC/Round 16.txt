fire goddess, from whom this hero earlier receives ten fingernails and toenails filled with fire. This hero
uses a stone axe to kill Long Eel, or Tuna, for spitting slime at his wife. This hero meets his end when
some nearby birds break out in laughter, causing the queen of the underworld to wake up while this hero
is trying to crawl into her body and gain (*) immortality. This husband of Hina uses his grandmother's jawbone
and a lasso made of his sister's hair to beat the sun into submission and lengthen the day. In another story, he uses a

ANSWER: Maui [accept longer answers that include the name Maui] <Kim>
2. A city in this state was the site of the 1909 Greek Town Riot. It's not Tennessee, but it secured large
government-owned hydroelectric power plants thanks to its senator George W. Norris. A politician from
this state resigned a Secretary of State to protest America's entry into World War I. Ignatius Donnelly
wrote a political platform named after the largest city in this state for the (*) Populist Party. Settlers in this

are often plotted on bell-shaped utilization curves along a resource spectrum above variables like prey
size. Joseph Connell's studies of barnacles on rocks documented the concept of the "realized width" of

5. Jan Tinbergen developed a model for this phenomenon which uses an equation similar to the law of
universal gravitation to predict its amount. Another model of this phenomenon assumes that labor is the

2x2x2 (2 by 2 by 2) model that allows for variances in both capital and labor. Paul Krugman was awarded
the Nobel Prize for his work in this area, which is described by the (*) Heckscher-Ohlin Model. The most

optical fibers. The original derivation of this effect failed to predict the Arago point and two other neutral
points of zero polarization. The intensity of this phenomenon is proportional to wavenumber to the fourth
power and varies inversely with the (*) sixth power of radius. Its cross-section is proportional to the sinesquared of the angle, which creates a polarization pattern that varies with azimuth. This effect, which occurs only if

accende amore," while passing himself off as a substitute music tutor. Played by a tenor, this character
sings "Ecco, ridente in cielo" while disguised as the student (*) Lindoro at the beginning of one opera. In
another opera, played by a baritone or bass, this character plans to revive the droit du seigneur to sleep with his valet's
wife Susanna, but is exposed by his own wife Rosina. For 10 points, name this character from Rossini's The Barber of
Seville, a nobleman who also appears as Figaro's antagonistic boss in Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro.
ANSWER: Count Almaviva [or Il Conte di Almaviva or just "The Count"] <Rosenberg>
9. Members of this profession were often buried in hollowed-out trees rather than the ground. A device
called the ngoni was first used by these people. While kidnapped, a man in this profession found that a
rival king was invulnerable unless shot with an arrow tipped by a white rooster's nail. These people were
seen in green feathered costumes by traveler (*) ibn Battuta. One of these people named Balla Fasseke was at
Kirina as his king defeated the Soso kingdom of Sumanguru. The Mandinka term for these people is used less often
than a French term of unknown origin which may mean "servant" or "one who shouts." For 10 points, name these

West Africa.

problem in "deep" types of this structure. Enlarged and twisted examples of these structures are termed
(*) "varicose." The largest of these valved, vascular structures is the inferior vena cava, and the pulmonary one is

chapters of a text like it is taken to be evidence for this book's inimitability. This text, which declares that
there is "no compulsion in religion," can be read in a month by dividing it into thirty equally-apportioned
(*) juz. An expunged, supposedly anti-monotheistic portion of this book that references three pagan goddess is

16. This process can be performed everywhere on entire functions. The arc length of a function f from a to
b is the integral of square root quantity one plus this operation of f squared. When this operation can be
repeated infinitely, the input function is called smooth. The Jacobian is the determinant of a matrix whose
entries come from performing this operation. It cannot be performed at the origin for the (*) absolute value
