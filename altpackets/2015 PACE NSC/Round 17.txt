PACE NSC 2015 - Round 17 - Tossups
1. A novel by this author contains chapters describing "the Massacre of the Coconut Isles" and "the
Skirmish in Normandy." This author's recurring character G.H. Bondy sells thousands of free-energyproducing Karburators in one novel, and in another finances a pearl-fishing business involving the title
creatures that is organized by Captain van Toch. A play by this man opens with a man dictating to his
secretary (*) Sulla and later suddenly proposing to a representative of the League of Humanity. That play by this
man ends with Alquist trying to recreate a formula burned by Helena and dubbing Primus and Helena the new
Adam and Eve. For 10 points, name this author of The Absolute at Large and The War with the Newts, a Czech writer
who introduced the term "robot" in R.U.R.
ANSWER: Karel Capek ["cha-peck", but literal English readings are also acceptable] <Brownstein>
2. This man cooks a meal for forty people in a story that he narrates in which he is the only man to
respond to a thrice-addressed plea for help. This man's letters and sermons are collected in the volume
The Peak of Eloquence. This man tore down a door to use as a shield in a battle fought against the Jews of
Khaybar Oasis, after which he was awarded the appellation "Lion of God." The Kharijites (*) rejected this
man's leadership, and assassinated him while he was praying in Kufah, ending the first Fitna. Though some consider
this man the last of the four rightly-guided Caliphs, others think he is the first post-Muhammad Imam. For 10
points, name this son-in-law of Muhammad, whose importance is disputed by the Sunnis and Shia.
ANSWER: Ali ibn Abi Talib [or al-Murtaza; or Amir Al-Mu'mineen; or Bab-e-Madinatul-ilm; or Murtadha;
or Asadullah; or Haydar] <Gupta>
3. A group of protesters within this movement, infamous for covering paint spots on walls with graffiti of
dwarves, is known as the Orange Alternative. This movement distributed the banned text Theses on Hope
and Hopelessness, and grew out of a precursor called the KOR. This movement was reluctantly granted
legal status by First Secretary of the PUWP, Edward Gierek. By engaging in the (*) Round Table Talks, this
movement secured free elections in 1989 after the resignation of Wojciech Jaruzelski (VOI-check YA-ru-zelski).
This movement was impelled by the first papal trip taken by John Paul II to his home country, and it was led by a
former electrician at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk. For 10 points, name this anti-Communist trade union led by
Lech Walesa in Poland.
ANSWER: Solidarity [or Solidarnosc; or Independent Self-governing Trade Union "Solidarity"; or Niezalezny

4. Three of these figures who can only say "da" or "ja", rather than "yes" and "no," feature in George
Boolos's Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever. Xenophanes wrote a scathing critique of earlier Greek views about
them. Cicero wrote a three-book dialogue On the Nature of beings of this sort. In an early Platonic
dialogue, a man who claims to be close to them insists on suing his father. Louis-Auguste Blanqui coined
an anarchist slogan demanding (*) none of these beings and "no masters." A dilemma in which the love of these
beings seems to be arbitrary is presented in Plato's dialogue Euthyphro, which equates love for these beings with
piety. For 10 points, name these beings whose existence is denied by as mere "delusion" by Richard Dawkins and
other New Atheists.
ANSWER: gods [or deities] <Jackson>

5. Like pressure, this quantity is plotted on the y-axis of Fletcher-Munson contours after scaling via Aweighting. The net value for this quantity is zero in a diffuse field but is maximized in the active field.
This quantity is proportional to both frequency squared and maximum displacement squared, or
alternatively, it equals one-half the pressure squared over a non-electrical quantity called impedance. This
quantity equals the product of particle velocity and pressure. It drops off with one over radius squared
since it equals power over the (*) surface area of an imaginary sphere. The level of this quantity equals ten times
the logarithm of it divided by one picowatt per square meter—a reference value also known as the threshold of
hearing. For 10 points, name this quantity often measured in decibels.

6. The colonial governors of this modern-day country demanded the output from 1/5th of each village's
land through the Culture System established in the 1830s. Wahabi converts in this nation rebelled against
aristocratic chiefs in the Padri War. Forces from this nation carried out the Santa Cruz Massacre against
supporters of FRETILIN during its occupation of a territory that seceded in 2002. A wave of violence
followed a failed coup by its (*) 30 September Movement. Its first leader advocated internationalism as part of
his Pancasila policy and practiced "Guided Democracy" after expelling the Japanese and throwing off the Dutch
colonial yoke. For 10 points, name this island country whose first post-independence leader was Sukarno, the
world's most populous Muslim nation.
ANSWER: Republic of Indonesia <Bentley>
7. In the Levins metapopulation model, the carrying capacity is one minus the rate of this process divided
by the colonization rate. In island biogeography, species richness equilibrates where the rate of this
process equals the colonization rate. Species formerly thought to have undergone this process are called
Lazarus taxa. In the IUCN Red List, the opposite end of (*) "least concern" indicates that this process
happened. Climate change may have contributed to this process in the golden toad. One of the largest "mass"
examples happened at the Permian-Triassic boundary, and its main anthropogenic cause is habitat degradation. For
10 points, name this phenomenon in which the population of a species declines to zero, which happened to the
passenger pigeon in 1914.
ANSWER: extinction <Kothari>
8. A character in this novel dies shortly after learning of the death of his favorite daughter Una. Another of
its characters becomes rich selling beans in an effort motivated by his father's failure in a refrigerated
lettuce-shipping venture. In this novel, the cook Lee tells a story about his Chinese relatives learning
Hebrew to study the Bible, during which they discover that the word (*) timshel translates as "thou mayest".

takes over a brothel after abandoning her family, including her sons Cal and Aron. Its protagonist marries the
villainous Cathy Ames before moving to the Salinas Valley. For 10 points, name this novel about Adam Trask, by
John Steinbeck.
ANSWER: East of Eden <Carson>
9. One of this artist's recurring symbols was inspired by a childhood incident in which he witnessed a
dead bat being devoured. In one of his paintings, fingers protrude from the earth while holding a cracked
egg from which a flower grows, although the crack also appears to be the flower's shadow. This painter of
The (*) Metamorphosis of Narcissus often used ants to symbolize decay, and he included a small portrait of his wife
Gala in The Hallucinogenic Toreador. He also painted "The Disintegration of" an earlier painting, which he claimed was
inspired by Camembert cheese and not Einstein's theory of relativity. For 10 points, name this Catalan surrealist
who painted melting clocks in The Persistence of Memory.
ANSWER: Salvador Dalí <Rosenberg>

names and years "spelt by the unlettered muse". It also imagines how "Chill penury" repressed the
"noble rage" of a "heart once pregnant with (*) celestial fire". This poem's speaker imagines a "Cromwell
guiltless of his country's blood" or a "mute inglorious Milton" inhabiting this poem's title location, from which a
ploughman "plods his weary way" as "the curfew tolls the knell of parting day". For 10 points, name this meditation
on death, an elegy by Thomas Gray.

habitat of the bony-tongued arapaima fish joins a darker-colored tributary at the (*) Meeting of Waters after
