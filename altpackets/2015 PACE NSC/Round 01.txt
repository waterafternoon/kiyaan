3. This man's theology was examined by Marisilio Ficino, a prominent Florentine. Ralph Cudworth led a
group of theologians inspired by this man at Cambridge. He's neither W.V.O. Quine nor Hillary Putnam,
but this man's name often denotes the philosophical view that mathematical objects are ontologically real

them. The larger completion of this set can be constructed from it by partitioning it, then taking the least
upper bound of the lesser partition. (*) Algebraic numbers are the roots of polynomials whose coefficients come
from this set. This set is the starting point for doing Dedekind cuts, and it is dense in the reals. The set of all of
these numbers is denoted Q, and they have eventually repeating or terminating decimal expansions. For 10 points,
identify these numbers, which, for integers a and b, can be written as the fraction a over b.
ANSWER: rational numbers <Schindler>

5. This color appears in the title of a story in which the narrator sees a white patch on a "brute beast"
slowly resolve itself into the shape of a gallows. A clock of this color regularly interrupts the musicians in a

with the black eyes of his lover in "Recondita Armonia." The villain uses a fan to arouse the title
character's jealousy and convince her to betray (*) Angelotti in exchange for her lover's life. That title character

realizing that Cavaradossi's "fake" execution was real after all. For 10 points, name this opera in which the title
singer stabs the wicked police chief Scarpia, by Giacomo Puccini.
ANSWER: Tosca <Rosenberg>

wits ends when the words that were once (*) whispered into this god's ear cannot be identified by Vafthrudnir.
Plans to retrieve this deity go awry when the jotun Thokk refuses to weep. This god's mother Frigg makes all but
one substance in the world promise never to harm this god. For 10 points, name this brother of Hoder, a Norse

through the redshift-independent SZ effect. The selection rule delta J equals plus or minus one applies to
rotational spectroscopy using this type of radiation. This radiation has frequency slightly greater than
ultra-high or super-high frequency radiation. Radiation at (*) 2.7 Kelvin has its maximum intensity wavelength

13. Selegiline raises the availability of this compound by selectively inhibiting MAO-B. This compound's
second G protein-coupled receptor, which inhibits adenylyl cyclase, is targeted by many antipsychotic
drugs. This compound's beta-hydroxylase catalyzes its transformation into norepinephrine. The ventral

16. In preparation for World War I, workers in this industry were granted an eight-hour day through the
Adamson Act. In the Civil War, Herman Haupt supervised this industry for the Union and War Secretary
Simon Cameron resigned due to his role in profiteering from it. An 1862 act issued bonds to a company in
this industry established by Theodore Judah and financed by the Big Four. A Civil War raid using (*)
infrastructure from this industry inspired Buster Keaton's film The General. Ruined infrastructure from this industry

industry eventually completed at Promontory Point with the driving in of a golden spike. For 10 points, the Union
Pacific Company is in which industry?
ANSWER: railroads [or rail industry; prompt on transportation] <Bentley>

modeled as a double-well potential between donors and acceptors. SN1 reactions, but not SN2, are sped
up by solvents demonstrating this effect. It is often incorrectly given as the reason for the higher melting
temperatures of CG-rich DNA sequences. This interaction occurs perpendicular to the chains of
antiparallel (*) beta sheets and links the amide groups of every fourth residue of an alpha helix. Alcohols have
higher boiling points than ethers because of this phenomenon. This strong class of dipole-dipole forces classically
requires nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine to be present. For 10 points, name this intermolecular attractive force

diplomat Ana Pauker. A dictator in this country encouraged women to become "heroine mothers" by
having ten or more children, and controlled his populace with the Securitate secret police. The (*) Iron
Guard carried out the Final Solution in this country, which joined Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia in the Little

this country was tried and executed with his wife Elena on Christmas, 1989. For 10 points, name this Eastern
European country ruled by the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu (chow-SHES-koo).

to sea. This man's cousin Richard Sympson edited out nearly half of a manuscript this man wrote, in
which he described how he was taught languages by the Sorrel Nag and Glumdalclitch. In one episode, he
is arrested after putting out a fire by urinating on it, while in another, he is forced out of a community of
ultra-rational (*) horse-like creatures who believe him to be a Yahoo. He encounters the Little-Endians and BigEndians in a country whose leaders charge him with treason, forcing him to flee to Blefuscu. For 10 points, name

Jonathan Swift.

22. The momentum j-factor in the Chilton-Colburn analogy is given by a number describing this
phenomenon, divided by two. A constant factor of 1.33, times the square root of the Reynolds number,
gives the magnitude of this phenomenon on a flat plate. For high Reynolds numbers, the magnitude of
this force is proportional to the velocity squared, but in creeping flow, the dependence is (*) linear, with a
coefficient often symbolized b. This force is proportional to the radius and viscosity according to Stokes' Law for
spherical particles. The "form" contribution to this force is greater when a surface is perpendicular to the oncoming
streamlines. For 10 points, name this force that balances gravity at the terminal velocity, and opposes thrust in
fluids.
ANSWER: drag force [or air resistance; prompt on air friction] <Silverman>
23. Abraham Mendel Theben convinced this ruler to offer limited protections to Jews. This ruler appears
on the obverse of a namesake silver bullion thaler which was circulated for over two centuries. Wenzel
Anton von Kaunitz was state chancellor and foreign minister to this ruler, during whose reign the
physician Gerard van Swieten was sent to Moravia to investigate the existence of vampires. Charles (*)
VI's flagrant disregard for Salic law resulted in this ruler taking the throne. After this ruler's death, her country
underwent a decade of temporary reform under her son Joseph II. The Pragmatic Sanction attempted to legitimate
the rule of this queen, who lost the region of Silesia to Frederick the Great. For 10 points, name this 18th-century
queen of Austria.
ANSWER: Maria Theresa [or Maria Theresa Walburga Amalia Christina; or Maria Theresia; prompt on partial
answer] <Wang>
24. Deflection of starlight was observed by William Wallace Campbell while he was observing one of these
events at the Lick Observatory. Walter Grotrian and Bengt Edlen found that the green emission line found
as a result of these events was not actually a new element, but was instead highly ionized iron. Arthur
Eddington experimentally confirmed Einstein's theory of general relativity using one of these events in
1919. While working in Madras, Pierre (*) Janssen used one of these events to discover the element helium. The
"annular" type of this event occurs when a disk surrounds the occluding body. For 10 points, name these events

[10] Name this vector equal to the dipole moment per unit volume in a solid. In linear materials, the electric
susceptibility describes how this quantity appears in response to an electric field.
ANSWER: electric polarization density [do not accept "polarizability"]

18. Intravenously-administered arginine stimulates the secretion of this hormone, whose receptor is antagonized by
pegvisomant and is unresponsive in Laron syndrome. For 10 points each:
[10] Name this oft-abused hormone produced in the anterior pituitary whose secretion is inhibited by somatostatin.
As the name might suggest, it is underproduced in many kinds of dwarfism, and overproduced in gigantism.
ANSWER: human growth hormone [or HGH; or somatotropin; or somatropin]
[10] Growth hormone is also released during times of stress, much like this catecholamine that controls the fight-orflight response with norepinephrine.
ANSWER: epinephrine [or adrenaline; or beta-3,4-trihydroxy-N-methylphenethylamine]
[10] The hypothalamus regulates growth hormone production by secreting GHRH, which then travels through the
"hypophyseal" type of this kind of blood vessel system, in which a capillary bed pools to another capillary bed
through veins without going through the heart. Another one supplies the liver.
ANSWER: portal venous system <Gupta>
19. Caitlin Flanagan wrote about the "dark power" of these organizations in a March 2014 Atlantic article that

roots and shoots.
