1. Goods produced by this ethnic group were carried by the ship United Kalavryta, which was stuck in
legal limbo for six months off the coast of Texas in 2014. Photographer Jacob Russell captured many
images of female fighters of this ethnic group within a force whose name means "one who faces death."
These people, who made up a plurality of the short lived Mahabad Republic after World War II, have yet
to carry out a (*) self-rule referendum proposed by Masoud Barzani. Soldiers from this ethnic group's peshmerga
force helped defend the city of Kobani against an ISIS siege. In Halabja, thousands of people of this ethnic group
were killed in a gas attack orchestrated by Saddam Hussein. For 10 points, name this ethnic group concentrated in
Turkey and Northern Iraq.
ANSWER: Kurds [or Iraqi Kurds; do not prompt on just "Iraqis"] <Bentley>
2. This quantity multiplies residence time in the Damköhler number, and is divided by the diffusivity in
the Thiele modulus. The exponential of one-half, times the square root of eight times Boltzmann's
constant over pi, appears in a classical derivation for this quantity. The kinetic isotope effect is a ratio of
these quantities. This quantity has units of molarity to the one minus n, over seconds, where n is the (*)
order. The natural logarithm of two, divided by this quantity, equals the half-life. According to collision theory, this
quantity equals a pre-exponential factor times e to the negative activation energy, over RT, by the Arrhenius
equation. For 10 points, name this constant which measures how quickly a reaction occurs.
ANSWER: reaction rate constant [prompt on reaction rate; prompt on k] <Silverman>

the painting Gersaint's Shop Sign by Jean-Antoine Watteau. One of these places was filled with millions of
porcelain sunflower seeds by Ai Weiwei ("eye" way-way) and is called (*) Turbine Hall. One in Washington,
DC is split between a neoclassical west building and an east building designed by I. M. Pei, who also designed a

4. In spaces described by this adjective, disjoint closed sets have disjoint open neighborhoods. Subgroups
of this type are invariant under conjugation. Numbers of this type have uniformly distributed digits in

of the function is parallel to a vector of this type. A set of mutually (*) perpendicular vectors with unit length
is called ortho-[this word]. The average of many independent random variables will approach a distribution named
after this adjective, according to the central limit theorem. In that distributions, 68% of data falls within one
standard deviation of the mean. For 10 points, identify this adjective which names the Gaussian bell-curve
distribution.
ANSWER: normal [prompt on perpendicular or bell] <Schindler>

5. According to one thinker, this pair of concepts took on their present meaning after a process of
ressentiment took hold among people akin to weak lambs being preyed upon by eagles. That same
philosopher attributed the rise of this conceptual dichotomy to "three Jews," namely Jesus, Peter, and
Paul. These concepts partly title a book which lauds the "free spirit" and opens by comparing past

issuance of the Edict of Union. Jaroslaw Dabrowski (YA-row-slav da-BROV-ski) died on one of these
objects during the "Bloody Week." Many of them were built following the end of the "banquets
campaign." The Mobile Guard destroyed many of these structures erected after the closing of the
National Workshops. Henry, Duke of Guise, seized power on the so-called (*) "Day" of these structures.

something he had nothing to do with." The Six Companies, Inc. joint venture was founded to oversee this
project, superintended by chief engineer Frank Crowe. The Bureau of (*) Reclamation received its first mass

this particle's wavefunction has a positive imaginary exponential. In a famous photograph, one of these
particles travels through a lead plate and loses its radius of curvature as it travels upward.
Fluorodeoxyglucose is a source of these particles. Pauli and Weisskopf explained how this particle gives a
