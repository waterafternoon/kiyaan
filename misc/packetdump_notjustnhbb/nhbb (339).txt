Seven Veils” from Richard Strauss’s opera  
Salome 
. Smetana's \"Die Moldau\" begins with two of these 
instruments playing rapid notes representing streams. Edgard Varese composed  
Density 21.5

4. The kinetics of this process is often studied using laser temperature jump spectroscopy, and it can also be 
studied using dual polarization interferometry. A common technique used to study this process is phi-value 
analysis, and chevron plots are used to depict this process. The timescale of this process is the subject of the 
Levinthal paradox. Anfinsen showed that this process is solely dependent on the sequence of the molecule 
undergoing it in an experiment using ribonuclease, and this process is often assisted by chaperones in the 
cell. When this process goes awry, prions can form, and this process results in the formation of tertiary and 
quaternary structures. For 10 points, name this process by which a protein assumes its three-dimensional 
shape after synthesis.
