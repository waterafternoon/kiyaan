2. The \"general\" kind of these proteins form the pre-initiation complex. The binding sites of these proteins 
can be determined by the ChIP-Seq assay, and they bind to consensus sites. These proteins consist of a 
DBD region and a TAD region where they can be regulated. These proteins often contain motifs like 
helix-turn-helix and leucine zippers. Six of them are found in the basal preinitiation complex, while another 
of these found in humans binds to the TATA box. The function of these proteins is affected by the 
methylation or acetylation of surrounding histones. They work by binding to either enhancer or promoter 
regions. For 10 points, name these proteins which affect the rate at which RNA strands are copied from 
DNA.
